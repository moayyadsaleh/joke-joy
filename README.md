# joke-joy
This web app is a user-friendly web application that brings joy and laughter to the user by fetching data from Joke API and displaying hilarious jokes to the users. To build this app, I utilized my expertise in various technical skills, including:

Node.js: I harnessed the power of Node.js, a versatile and efficient JavaScript runtime, to create the server-side logic of the application. This allowed me to handle HTTP requests, communicate with Joke API, and manage data efficiently.

Express.js:  I set up the server using Express.js and created routes to handle incoming requests from clients. 

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): I used EJS as the templating engine to dynamically generate HTML content with the fetched data from Joke API. This allowed me to render jokes on the client-side efficiently and maintain a clean separation between the presentation and the logic.

JavaScript (JS): As the backbone of the frontend, JS played a crucial role in handling user interactions and updating the UI dynamically. I employed modern JS techniques to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

API Integration: By making API calls and processing the data, I ensured the users always had content to enjoy.

Asynchronous Programming: To optimize performance and responsiveness, I utilized asynchronous programming with promises and async/await. This way, the app could handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution.

Error Handling: I implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage any issues that might arise during data fetching or API interactions.

Responsive Design: I designed the user interface to be responsive, allowing JokeJoy to adapt and provide an optimal experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Version Control (Git): Throughout the development process, I used Git for version control, enabling me to manage changes effectively.
Deployment: Finally, I deployed the JokeJoy web app on a Heroku, a reliable hosting platform, making it accessible to users worldwide.
